# Python-datastructures
In Python, the main data structures are lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Each of these data structures has unique properties and is suited to different tasks. Hereâ€™s a brief but precise breakdown:

## 1. Lists
Definition: Ordered, mutable collections of items.
Syntax: Defined with square brackets [].
### Properties:
Mutable: Items can be added, removed, or changed.<br>
Indexed: Supports indexing and slicing, making it easy to access elements.<br>
Allows Duplicates: Can contain multiple items with the same value.<br>
**Example:** <br>my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



## 2. Tuples
Definition: Ordered, immutable collections of items.<br>
Syntax: Defined with parentheses ().
### Properties:
Immutable: Cannot be modified after creation (no adding, removing, or changing elements).<br>
Indexed: Supports indexing and slicing.<br>
Allows Duplicates: Can contain duplicate values.<br>
**Example:** <br>my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)


## 3. Sets
Definition: Unordered, mutable collections of unique items.<br>
Syntax: Defined with curly braces {} or using the set() function.<br>
### Properties:
Mutable: Items can be added or removed, but only unique values are stored.<br>
Unordered: No indexing or slicing (does not maintain order).<br>
No Duplicates: Automatically removes duplicate items.<br>
**Example:** <br>
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

## 4. Dictionaries
Definition: Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs.<br>
Syntax: Defined with curly braces {}, where each item has a key: value pair.<br>
### Properties:
Mutable: Pairs can be added, removed, or updated.<br>
Key-Value Mapping: Allows efficient lookups and modifications by key.<br>
Keys are Unique: No duplicate keys, but values can be duplicated.<br>
**Example:** <br>
my_dict = {"Name": "Alice", "Age": 25, "City": "New York"}

### Each of these data structures provides specific functionality:

Lists are best for ordered data collections that need frequent modifications.<br>
Tuples are used for fixed, ordered collections where immutability is essential.<br>
Sets are optimal for collections where uniqueness and quick membership testing are needed.<br>
Dictionaries are ideal for mappings and structured data with key-value pairs.<br>
